# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-07)

**Core value:** A clinician can document a complete treatment session producing a locked, auditable medical record
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Session Lifecycle

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (Session Lifecycle)
Plan: 3 of 4 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-07 -- Completed 02-03 consent, contraindication, and module services

Progress: [████████░░] 80%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 8
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: 0.49 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 6 | 22min | 4min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5min), 01-02 (5min), 01-03 (8min), 01-04 (7min), 01-05 (2min)
- Trend: stable

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P05 | 2min | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 02 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 15 files |
| Phase 02 P03 | 4min | 2 tasks | 9 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Service/repository layer introduced in Phase 1 before clinical domains
- [Roadmap]: Hybrid polymorphism for modules -- shared session_modules table + per-type detail tables
- [Roadmap]: Energy-based modules (Phase 3) before injectables (Phase 4) to validate both patterns sequentially
- [Roadmap]: Database-level immutability via triggers deferred to Phase 5 after all module types exist
- [01-00]: Used //go:build ignore tag for test and mock scaffolds pending service interface creation
- [01-00]: Defined placeholder domain types in mocks.go before actual domain types exist
- [01-01]: Sentinel errors use package-level vars with nolint:gochecknoglobals for golangci-lint compatibility
- [01-01]: Mock repositories split into per-domain files to allow independent build-ignore management
- [01-02]: Role field uses json omitempty tag for backward compatibility with pre-migration tokens
- [01-02]: Login and refresh handler callers updated in Task 1 (Rule 3 blocking fix) due to GenerateAccessToken signature change
- [01-02]: First-user bootstrap is non-fatal on error to avoid blocking registration
- [01-04]: Registry repository interface includes type/module filter parameters for flexible query filtering
- [01-04]: Device list excludes handpieces for performance; detail endpoint loads them separately
- [01-04]: Domain types used directly as API response bodies for read-only registry
- [Phase 01-03]: ILIKE prefix search with LOWER() functional indexes for patient search
- [Phase 01-03]: Session count/last_session_date are hardcoded placeholders (0/null) until Phase 2 sessions
- [Phase 01-03]: Per-domain mock files (mock_patient.go) instead of monolithic mocks.go
- [Phase 01-03]: Handler applies pagination defaults before service call for accurate response values
- [01-05]: Used helper functions (newPatientTestRouter, newPatientTestDeps) to reduce handler test duplication
- [Phase 02-01]: IsValidTransition exported as helper for tests and documentation
- [Phase 02-01]: validTransitions allows AwaitingSignoff -> InProgress for rejection/rework flow
- [Phase 02-01]: SessionService takes 3 repo deps (session, consent, module) for consent gate checks
- [Phase 02-03]: SELECT EXISTS pattern for consent gate check (ExistsForSession) for efficiency
- [Phase 02-03]: Module method tests in separate session_module_test.go to avoid merge conflicts with parallel plan 02-02
- [Phase 02-03]: Screening duplicate check uses GetBySessionID+ErrScreeningNotFound vs ExistsForSession per plan spec

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: pgx v4 reached EOL July 2025. Migration to v5 should happen but not interleaved with feature work.
- [Research]: Exact field specs per module type need spreadsheet data during plan-phase.
- [Research]: Seed data content (real device models, product names) needs clinical input.
